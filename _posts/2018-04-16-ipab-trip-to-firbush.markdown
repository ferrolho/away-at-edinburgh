A long time ago, in an Informatics Forum far, far away....

We arrived safe and sound at Firbush after a 2-hour trip through the winding roads of Scotland.

Just as you would expect from a bunch of PhD students, as soon as we unloaded our stuff from the coach, we hit the bar.

On Saturday morning, we had the chance to see how beautiful the loch was during daytime.

Saturday was Kayaking and Canoeing day.

The most awaited activity had been windsurf. On Saturday there was not enough wind but on Sunday there was.
Most people described windsurf as 'being 2 hours in the cold water trying to get back on the board' though.

On Sunday morning some of us went orienteering. It turned out to be a 4-hour long activity going through deep woods and sometimes muddy swamps.
It was very well worth it though.

At some point, we found the most random chair ever in a glade of the forest.
Of course we had to get a picture on top of it.

And that's it! Hopefully we will go back this September, for another weekend of stress-relief activities.
