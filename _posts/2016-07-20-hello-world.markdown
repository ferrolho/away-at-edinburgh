My name is Henrique Ferrolho, I am from Portugal, and as of today I am 21 years old. I'm about to finish my Masters in Informatics and Computing Engineering. I am also a TA at FEUP, and a tech enthusiast in general. I am very interested in AI, genetic algorithms, bioinformatics, machine learning, and philosophy.

I am starting this blog because during the next semester, from September till the end of December, I will be studying abroad. I will be going to Edinburgh, Scotland; and I thought 'Well, why don't I start writing some kind of journal about it?'

So... here goes nothing!
