Today was a very good day. I just finished all my exams - that's it, I'm done! Now I just need to look for a new room... Yes, it turns out I will not be going back to Portugal so fast. I mean, I will be going there for Christmas and New Year's eve, but I will be returning to Scotland.

That's right. I got one of the best opportunities I could ever have asked for. I am going to be developing software for a NASA robot. You heard it right: f\*\*\*ing **NASA**! Words can't even describe how I'm feeling right now...

This probably means the blog is not going to end so fast. I will surely need somewhere to write from time to time. It only makes sense to keep this going so I can save my experience for posterity.

So... that means this is not a goodbye.

Just remember...
