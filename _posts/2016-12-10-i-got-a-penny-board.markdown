Hey! No time for big posts, but here's a quick update.
I decided to treat myself with an early Christmas present.
I got myself a Penny Board! Yay! &#x1F603;

I never learnt how to skate, so why not during exams season? If I fall and break something, that would really help me!

So - besides stu*dying* - that's what I've been doing: learning... slowly...

Which is nice! Helps me get my head off the exams for a bit.
