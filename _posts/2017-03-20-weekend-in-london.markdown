I went to London for the weekend and I had a pretty good time. I hadn't been to London since like... 2009? And I was just a kid at the time so I didn't get the chance to go around freely.

As you might have guessed already, this post is going to be mainly constituted from pictures I took while I was there.

I was hosted very close to the *'Gherkin'*, in the *City of London*.

*City of London* has some very impressive and tall buildings.

		<strong>Tower 42</strong> is the third-tallest skyscraper in the City of London and the eighth tallest in Greater London. Its original name was the <strong>NatWest Tower</strong> (or National Westminster Tower). With <strong>47 floors</strong>, it is <strong>183 metres</strong> high.

Like always, I took my Penny Board with me.

London has one of the best pavements to go around and explore the city while enjoying a smooth ride.

I finally visited the *'Shard'*. I have been meaning to see it in person. I find it a magnificent and very interesting building.

It is definitely the tallest building I've stood next to. While standing at the very bottom, it's a weird feeling to look above and not being able to see the top.

I wanted to go to the top. Well, actually visitors can only go up until the floor number 72, but it costs like *Â£30*... Plus, it was getting dark and we wanted to go to other places.

I particularly like this next picture I took. I like the contrast between the *old* and the *new*.

*Tiago* and *Sara* have moved to *Edgware* recently. They joined me as soon as I got to London so we could go around together and make the most out of the surprisingly very warm and sunny days.

We were roaming around near *Picadilly* when we stumbled across *Chinatown*!

And this was it. I really liked visiting London and I wish I could have stayed longer.

I couldn't have had more luck with the weather.
