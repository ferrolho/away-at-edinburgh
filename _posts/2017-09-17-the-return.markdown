I am back. Yes, I have returned to Edinburgh and I am starting my PhD in Robotics and Autonomous Systems (RAS).
It's hard to express what all this implies, so I won't go into much details about that (at least in this post).

Edinburgh is becoming a very tough city when it comes to finding a place to live. The demand has increased a lot and the rent prices have escalated. But finally I managed to get a place: I am now living in University accommodation.

I share the flat with 4 other people: Yuqi, Kayue, Wenbin (from China), and Nosa (from Nigeria).

Following are some pictures I took of the current state of my room.
I had to move the furniture around because I really didn't like how stuff was layed out.
This is without doubt the best room I've had in Edinburgh.

So, without further ado:

		Nothing like a bunch of pictures of yours to brighten up the place a little and make it feel more like <em>home</em>.
		By the way, I had to get that poster as soon as I saw it, really. If you haven't seen this movie, here is a handy link to its IMDB entry: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117951/">Trainspotting</a>, with regards from Obi-Wan Kenobi.

		This is like one of those <a href="https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-clean-blog/">online website template pictures</a> of places that are tidied up for one shot but other than that are always a mess in real life.<br>
