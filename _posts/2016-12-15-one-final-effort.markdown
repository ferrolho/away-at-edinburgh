This is it. Tomorrow is the big day. If I pass all the three exams I have sat so far, and the exam I will sit tomorrow, I will never sit an exam **ever again**! Hopefully - and I sure hope so - I will have passed every exam, and therefore tomorrow will be my *last exam*.

I am exhausted. I really am tired and have grown old and weary on the last few weeks.

As I brush my teeth before going to bed, I've been looking in the mirror and asking: *Why did you do this to yourself? Why did you choose to take level 11 (maximum) courses with the 'high demand' option checked?*

Anyway, tomorrow is going to be an **exciting day**. And not only because it will be my last exam, no. Something *else* will take place. I've been waiti**N**g for it like a little kid w**A**its to open its fir**S**t *PlayStation* or *Xbox* that has been lying under the Christm**A**s tree since the beginning of December.

I just hope that everything goes well because my expectations are very very high. And at this point, if someone were to change its mind, I would get very disappointed, and the previous paragraph would be just a build up for an utter fail...

We shall see!
