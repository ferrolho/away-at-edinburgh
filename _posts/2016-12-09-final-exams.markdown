Hello there. Ok, so... very quick post!  
I need to get back to revising...  
Or at least try.

All the practical marks of the four courses I am taking have now been released. I did very well, and I am really happy for all the effort I've put into the assignments to have payed off.

## Exams

I do not like exams.

I do not agree with the weight assigned to exams.

It is stupid to have to sit for 2 hours, and in those 2 hours risking to ruin all the effort and all the long hours you have dedicated to the course throughout the previous 4 months.

Have I told you I do not like exams already?

## The next days will be chaotic

My exams start tomorrow - yes, an exam on a Saturday - with *Extreme Computing*, *Bioinformatics* on Monday, *Social and Tech Nets* on Thursday, and finally *Robotics* on Friday.

I am not prepared.

I had lots of days to revise, but I only started this week because I just didn't have the inner strength to start earlier. The course assignments really got the best of me and I needed some rest.

## I do not like exams

This is the first time that I think being away from Portugal has had an impact on my performance.

At FEUP - my home college - a lot of the people taking an exam choose to go to a big room and study all together. This is good because **(1)** you get to explain stuff to each other, and **(2)** you get to share the pain of having to do something you don't like - the latter is of utmost importance.

Since I am an exchange student I will have to sit all the exams now - here in Edinburgh the normal examination diet is around May. Everyone I know has already gone back to their hometown because they are only taking the exams in a couple of months from now.

Studying for an exam alone is not that great. Hopefully, these will be the last exams I will have to take before I finish my Master's degree.

Right, back to *Hadoop MapReduce* and *Data Warehousing* now... bye!
