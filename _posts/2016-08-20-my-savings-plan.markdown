Studying abroad is expensive. Surely, there are destinations far more expensive than others. But going away to a foreign country for a certain period of time is always more expensive than keep studying (or partying) wherever you are. If you don't want to be a burden on your parents, you should think of a savings plan in advance.

I started my savings plan almost **2 years ago**. At the time, I didn't know where I wanted to go to, nor if I would be selected to go. But I had great expectations, and I knew I wanted to go to one of the best colleges in Europe if I got the chance - **usually the more expensive**. And if I had such chance, I didn't want to waste it because I didn't have enough money. So it only made sense to start saving *as soon* as I could, long before now - when I am 15 days away from leaving. *Yay!*

There's one thing I'd like to note though:

> ## Do not keep yourself from living the present on the prospect of having a better future.

What I mean is: **yes**, you should save money. But **no**, you shouldn't stop going out with your friends. There are so many things that can go wrong and compromise your plans! *What if* you end up not being selected? *What if* you get sick and cannot go anymore? In such cases you would end up repenting for only *planning the future*, and *wasting the present* with your family and friends.


### Enough chitchat. Let's do some arithmetic operations!

I have been working at FEUP for *two years* now as a TA. I also took part in two investigation projects - one last summer, and another in which I am *currently* working on. After some expenses, I managed to save **5.235€**.

As I mentioned on the previous post, my university will give me a scholarship of **1.350€** for studying abroad.

That adds up to a total of:  
5.235€ + 1.350€ = **6.585€**

Since Scotland is (still) part of the UK, let's convert that to British Pounds using the current rate: **5.700£**.

## Estimation of all the basic expenses:

###### I have already bought my one way ticket to Edinburgh, so that'll be off the next accounting.

- Rent and bills - **500£** *per month* * **4** months = **2.000£**
- Transportation pass - **45£** *per month* * **4** months = **180£**
- Mobile phone tariff - **10£** *per month* * **4** months = **40£**
- Flight back to Portugal - **200£**

Total expenses: **2.420£**

Which gives a remainder of:  
5.700£ - 2.420£ = **3.280£**

After all these estimations have been considered, below are the monthly and daily amounts I think I'll be left with for everyday expenses.

3.280£ / 4 months = **820£** *per month*  
820£ / 30 days = **27£** *per day*

And that's it! I think I've covered everything I wanted to. I hope this helps future students who wish to study abroad.
